#### Browser Usage ####
```html
<script src="/path/to/projections-js/dist/projections.min.js"></script>
```
```javascript
const { Projections, ProjectionConstants } = window.Projections;

const x = 22.0;
const y = 33.0;
const projection1 = Projections.getProjection(ProjectionConstants.AUTHORITY_EPSG, ProjectionConstants.EPSG_WEB_MERCATOR);
const projection2 = Projections.getProjectionForName("EPSG:4326");
const transform = Projections.getProjectionTransformation(projection1, projection2);
const transformed1 = transform.transform(x, y); // [x, y]
const transformed2 = transform.transformCoordinateArray([x, y]); // [x, y]
const transformed3 = transform.transformCoordinate({x, y}); // {x, y}
```
